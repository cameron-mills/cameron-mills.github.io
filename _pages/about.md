## About Me

Welcome to my blog! I'm a **Senior DevSecOps Engineer** with a deep-rooted passion for integrating development, security, and operations into cohesive, efficient workflows. My journey in tech began as a Systems Engineer, where I developed a strong foundation in managing and optimizing infrastructure, which eventually led me to specialize in DevSecOps. With over **7 years** of experience, I've dedicated myself to ensuring that security is a seamless part of the software delivery process.

## My Journey

Starting out as a Systems Engineer, I honed my skills in maintaining and securing critical infrastructure. Over time, I recognized the growing need for security to be an integral part of the development pipeline, not just an afterthought. This realization propelled me into the world of DevSecOps, where I've spent the last several years focusing on merging robust security practices with agile development and operational efficiency.

I've had the privilege of working in diverse environments, from fast-paced startups to large-scale enterprises, which has given me a well-rounded perspective on the challenges and opportunities in this field. My background in systems engineering has been invaluable in understanding the intricacies of infrastructure and how best to secure it within a CI/CD framework.
